# DartCounter

This was a fun/teambuilding project. Created in ~2hours int "hotseat" model. 
Three developers started to play Dart, two man played the game and the remaining one started to develop this application.
If the match ended the looser sit down to code and the another two started a new match and so on.

This was a great experience, we learned so much about the teammates coding style, developing patterns etc, and of course created the application to increase the "in game fun factor" :D

It's not well designed, has a lot of design flows, code smells, but it's working and maybe if we have more free time, we continue to develop later.
