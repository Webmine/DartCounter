# DartCounter

This was a fun/teambuilding project. Created in about 2 hours in "hotseat" model. 
Three developers started to play Darts, two played the game and the remaining one started to develop this application.
When the match ended the loser sat down to code and the other two started a new match and so on.

This was a great experience, we learned much about our teammates' coding style, developing patterns etc, and of course created the application to increase the "in game fun factor" :D

It's not well-designed, has a some flaws, code smells, but it's working and maybe if we have more free time, we continue to develop later.
